# DICE-FER Project: Disentangled Identity and Expression Representations for Facial Expression Recognition

This repository contains our course project implementation of the DICE-FER architecture for facial expression recognition (FER), developed as part of **EE656: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Its Applications** at **IIT Kanpur**.

Our goal was to disentangle expression and identity features from facial images using mutual information estimation and adversarial training.

## 📊 Dataset: RAF-DB

* The **Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB)** contains \~30,000 images labeled with 7 basic emotions:

  * Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, Neutral
* Pre-aligned, RGB face images
* We generated custom `labels.csv` files for PyTorch loading

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

We implemented a simplified DICE-FER pipeline consisting of:

* **Expression Encoder**: ResNet-18 → 128D features
* **Identity Encoder**: ResNet-18 → 128D features
* **Classifier Head**: Linear(128 → 7)
* **MINE Module**: Mutual information minimization between features
* **Discriminator**: Adversarial loss to enforce expression–identity disentanglement

---

## 🏋️ Training Setup

* **Stage 1**: Train expression encoder + classifier using:

  * MI loss, L1 loss, and cross-entropy loss
* **Stage 2**: Freeze expression encoder, train identity encoder + MINE + discriminator
* All models trained from scratch on RAF-DB (Colab)

## 📈 Evaluation & Results

We performed **linear probing** on expression features using logistic regression:

| Metric         | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Test Accuracy  | 82.27% |
| Macro F1 Score | 72.3%  |

Visual outputs:

* `expression_accuracy_plot.png`: accuracy over epochs
* `identity_loss_plot.png`: MI + adversarial loss trend
* `expression_confusion_matrix_testset.png`: test confusion matrix

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Work

While the original DICE-FER paper included more components, we focused on the core disentanglement pipeline. Components we did not implement:

* Ablation studies on loss terms
* Image retrieval from embeddings
* Cross-dataset evaluation (e.g., CK+, AffectNet)
* Use of multiple MINE modules (local/global)

These remain directions for future exploration.
